// PDO error function should be turned off for production


Could consolodate returnListOfAllClothingProducts() and returnListOfAllFoodProducts().


X-Site Scripting:
This app lacks a session class that makes unique fingerprints on each page load, which is then sent as a hidden <input>, and in the index.php file, would check the input sent fingerprint against the session fingerprint, and abort if those fingerprints don't match.
(most of these functions are already in class.sessions.php).


@HEREDOC:
Could contain @HEREDOC formatting in php file headers.
